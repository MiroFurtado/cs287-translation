When I was 11 , I remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
My father was listening to BBC News on his small , gray radio .
There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then , because the news mostly depressed him .
" The Taliban are gone ! " my father shouted .
" You can go to a real school now , " he said .
A morning that I will never forget .
A real school .
It was the only way we both could be educated .
Each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going .
We would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping .
The school was in a house , more than 100 of us packed in one small living room .
It was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer .
We all knew we were risking our lives -- the teacher , the students and our parents .
From time to time , the school would suddenly be canceled for a week because Taliban were suspicious .
We always wondered what they knew about us .
Were we being followed ?
Do they know where we live ?
We were scared , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured .
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
But my educated mother became a teacher .
There she is .
To him , there was greater risk in not educating his children .
Your money can be stolen . You can be forced to leave your home during a war .
So do you still not want to continue ? "
Today I am 22 .
I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
Instead , I stand here a proud graduate of Middlebury College .
My family believes in me .
I dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
That 's why I am a global ambassador for 10x10 , a global campaign to educate women .
It 's not to say that our mothers are n't key in our success .
Under the Taliban , girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds -- remember , it was illegal .
But today , more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americans see the fragility in changes .
Like me , they are dreaming big .
Thank you .
And I was distraught .
Instead , everything we touched we killed .
" Just in the nick of time to save the Zambian people from starvation . "
And of course , everything in Africa grew beautifully .
And we said to the Zambians , " My God , the hippos ! "
And the Zambians said , " Yes , that 's why we have no agriculture here . "
" Why did n't you tell us ? " " You never asked . "
Because , you see , at least we fed the hippos .
The book was published in 2009 .
We Western donor countries have given the African continent two trillion American dollars in the last 50 years .
I 'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has done .
Just go and read her book .
Read it from an African woman , the damage that we have done .
The two words come from the Latin root " pater , " which means " father . "
But they mean two different things .
Patronizing , I treat everybody from another culture as if they were my servants .
That 's why the white people in Africa are called " bwana , " boss .
This should be the first principle of aid .
The first principle of aid is respect .
So what you do -- you shut up .
You never arrive in a community with any ideas , and you sit with the local people .
We do n't work from offices .
We meet at the cafe . We meet at the pub .
We have zero infrastructure .
And what we do , we become friends , and we find out what that person wants to do .
The most important thing is passion .
You can give somebody an idea .
If that person does n't want to do it , what are you going to do ?
The passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing .
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing .
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge , but the knowledge is available .
Let me tell you a secret .
There is a problem with community meetings .
So planning has this blind spot .
You have to create a new profession .
I started this as a tryout in Esperance , in Western Australia .
I shut up , and listen to them . "
So — — So the government says , " Do it again . "
We 've done it in 300 communities around the world .
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses .
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of solitude .
Planning is the kiss of death of entrepreneurship .
You have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you .
In a community of 10,000 people , we get 200 clients .
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people , the intelligence and the passion ?
Which presentation have you applauded the most this morning ?
Local , passionate people . That 's who you have applauded .
So what I 'm saying is that entrepreneurship is where it 's at .
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable .
Freon way of maintaining things is not sustainable .
The technologies do not exist to do that .
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution ? Universities ? Forget about it !
Government ? Forget about it !
It will be entrepreneurs , and they 're doing it now .
There 's a lovely story that I read in a futurist magazine many , many years ago .
They were already drowning in manure .
Dearborn , Michigan . Henry Ford .
However , there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
First , you have to offer them confidentiality .
Otherwise they do n't come and talk to you .
Then you have to offer them absolute , dedicated , passionate service to them .
And then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship .
Guess what ?
It does n't exist .
This person has never been born .
Never the word " I , " and the word " we " 32 times .
He was n't alone when he started .
Nobody started a company alone . No one .
What can you do ? Can you make it ?
Okay , can you sell it ? Can you look after the money ? "
We activate communities .
Thank you .
Penn State asked me , a communications teacher , to teach a communications class for engineering students .
And I was scared .
And I believe the key to opening that door is great communication .
We desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world .
So scientists and engineers , please , talk nerdy to us .
First question to answer for us : so what ?
Tell us why your science is relevant to us .
And when you 're describing your science , beware of jargon .
Jargon is a barrier to our understanding of your ideas .
And making your ideas accessible is not the same as dumbing it down .
Instead , as Einstein said , make everything as simple as possible , but no simpler .
You can clearly communicate your science without compromising the ideas .
And when presenting your work , drop the bullet points .
Have you ever wondered why they 're called bullet points ?
Thank you .
Hi . This is my mobile phone .
A mobile phone can change your life , and gives you individual freedom .
With a mobile phone , you can shoot a crime against humanity in Syria .
With a mobile phone , you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt .
All this is possible with your mobile phone .
I 'm a child of 1984 , and I live in the city of Berlin .
Let 's go back to that time , to this city .
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and protested for change .
Who in the room has a mobile phone with you ?
Hold it up .
Hold your phones up , hold your phones up !
Hold it up . An Android , a Blackberry , wow .
That 's a lot . Almost everybody today has a mobile phone .
But today I will talk about me and my mobile phone , and how it changed my life .
And I will talk about this .
These are 35,830 lines of information .
Raw data .
And why are these informations there ?
Because in the summer of 2006 , the E.U. Commission tabled a directive .
This directive [ is ] called Data Retention Directive .
Who calls whom ? Who sends whom an email ?
Who sends whom a text message ?
And if you use your mobile phone , where you are .
And all over Europe , people stood up and said , " We do n't want this . "
They said , we do n't want this data retention .
They were lawyers , journalists , priests , they all said : " We do n't want this . "
And some even said , this would be Stasi 2.0 .
Stasi was the secret police in East Germany .
And I also ask myself , does it really work ?
Can they really store all this information about us ?
Every time I use my mobile phone ?
So I decided to start a lawsuit against them , because I wanted to have this information .
But Deutsche Telekom said , no , we will not give you this information .
So at the end , I had a settlement with them .
I 'll put down the lawsuit and they will send me all the information I ask for .
So I got this ugly brown envelope with a C.D. inside .
And on the C.D. , this was on .
Thirty - five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information .
At first I saw it , and I said , okay , it 's a huge file . Okay .
But then after a while I realized , this is my life .
This is six months of my life , into this file .
So I was a little bit skeptical , what should I do with it ?
Because you can see where I am , where I sleep at night , what I am doing .
But then I said , I want to go out with this information .
I want to make them public .
Because I want to show the people what does data retention mean .
So together with Zeit Online and Open Data City , I did this .
This is a visualization of six months of my life .
You can zoom in and zoom out , you can wind back and fast forward .
You can see every step I take .
All this is possible with this information .
That 's a little bit scary .
But it is not only about me .
It 's about all of us .
And then there are some friends calling me , and they call each other .
You can see all of this .
You can see the hubs , like who are the leaders in the group .
If you have access to this information , you can see what your society is doing .
If you have access to this information , you can control your society .
This is a blueprint for countries like China and Iran .
And this information is stored for at least six months in Europe , up to two years .
The fall of the Berlin Wall would maybe not [ have been ] there .
And in the aftermath , also not the fall of the Iron Curtain .
But self - determination and living in the digital age is no contradiction .
But you have to fight for your self - determination today .
You have to fight for it every day .
Thank you .
I live in South Central .
This is South Central : liquor stores , fast food , vacant lots .
This is South Los Angeles .
Liquor stores , fast food , vacant lots .
Funny thing is , the drive - thrus are killing more people than the drive - bys .
People are dying from curable diseases in South Central Los Angeles .
I got tired of seeing this happening .
I see wheelchairs bought and sold like used cars .
I see dialysis centers popping up like Starbucks .
And I figured , this has to stop .
So I figured that the problem is the solution .
Food is the problem and food is the solution .
So what I did , I planted a food forest in front of my house .
It was on a strip of land that we call a parkway .
It 's 150 feet by 10 feet .
Thing is , it 's owned by the city .
But you have to maintain it .
And this is how I decided to maintain it .
And the garden , it was beautiful .
And then somebody complained .
And I 'm like , " Come on , really ?
A warrant for planting food on a piece of land that you could care less about ? "
And I was like , " Cool . Bring it . "
Because this time it was n't coming up .
We had a victory on our hands .
My councilman even called in and said how they endorse and love what we 're doing .
I mean , come on , why would n't they ?
L.A. leads the United States in vacant lots that the city actually owns .
They own 26 square miles of vacant lots .
That 's 20 Central Parks .
That 's enough space to plant 725 million tomato plants .
Why in the hell would they not okay this ?
Growing one plant will give you 1,000 , 10,000 seeds .
When one dollar 's worth of green beans will give you 75 dollars ' worth of produce .
It 's my gospel , when I 'm telling people , grow your own food .
Growing your own food is like printing your own money .
See , I have a legacy in South Central .
I grew up there . I raised my sons there .
See , I 'm an artist .
Gardening is my graffiti . I grow my art .
Just like a graffiti artist , where they beautify walls , me , I beautiful lawns , parkways .
You 'd be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your canvas .
You just could n't imagine how amazing a sunflower is and how it affects people .
So what happened ?
To change the community , you have to change the composition of the soil .
We are the soil .
You 'd be surprised how kids are affected by this .
Gardening is the most therapeutic and defiant act you can do , especially in the inner city .
Plus you get strawberries .
This is on the street for a reason .
That 's why it 's on the street .
That 's the whole idea .
There 's another time when I put a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown Los Angeles .
These are the guys , they helped me unload the truck .
So Green Grounds has gone on to plant maybe 20 gardens .
If kids grow kale , kids eat kale .
If they grow tomatoes , they eat tomatoes .
And when we do this , who knows ?
We might produce the next George Washington Carver .
but if we do n't change the composition of the soil , we will never do this .
Now this is one of my plans . This is what I want to do .
I want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes .
Now do n't get me wrong .
I 'm not talking about no free shit , because free is not sustainable .
The funny thing about sustainability , you have to sustain it .
So what I want to do here , we got ta make this sexy .
So I want us all to become ecolutionary renegades , gangstas , gangsta gardeners .
We got ta flip the script on what a gangsta is .
If you ai n't a gardener , you ai n't gangsta .
Get gangsta with your shovel , okay ?
And let that be your weapon of choice .
Peace . Thank you .
Thank you .
One of my favorite words in the whole of the Oxford English Dictionary is " snollygoster . "
Just because it sounds so good .
And what snollygoster means is " a dishonest politician . "
Now I have no idea what " talknophical " is .
Something to do with words , I assume .
Most people think that 's down to the metal .
It 's not . It 's down to a campaigner for the freedom of the press .
And they had to face the question of what to call George Washington , their leader .
They did n't know .
What do you call the leader of a republican country ?
And this was debated in Congress for ages and ages .
And there were all sorts of suggestions on the table , which might have made it .
Not that catchy .
Some people just wanted to call him King .
They thought it was tried and tested .
And , you know , it could have worked .
And everybody got insanely bored , actually , because this debate went on for three weeks .
And the reason for the delay and the boredom was that the House of Representatives were against the Senate .
The House of Representatives did n't want Washington to get drunk on power .
They did n't want to call him King in case that gave him ideas , or his successor ideas .
So they wanted to give him the humblest , meagerest , most pathetic title that they could think of .
And that title was " President . "
It was like the foreman of the jury .
And it did n't have much more grandeur than the term " foreman " or " overseer . "
And that 's why the Senate objected to it .
They said , that 's ridiculous , you ca n't call him President .
This guy has to go and sign treaties and meet foreign dignitaries .
And after three weeks of debate , in the end the Senate did not cave in .
Now you can learn three interesting things from this .
Reality and history have endowed that title with grandeur .
And so the Senate won in the end .
They got their title of respectability .
But now , do you know how many nations have a president ?
A hundred and forty - seven .
All because they want to sound like the guy who 's got the 5,000 nuclear warheads , etc .
Thank you very much .
And this was my first time in Afghanistan .
But this is the geography of self .
And try and use this campaign to expose these mafiosos who are masquerading as national heroes .
But doing these things , they can get you in jail , they can be misunderstood , misinterpreted .
But I do them because I have to , because the geography of self mandates it .
That is my burden . What 's yours ?
Thank you .
Hi . My name is Cameron Russell , and for the last little while I 've been a model .
Actually , for 10 years .
So luckily I brought an outfit change .
Not everybody gets to do that .
These heels are very uncomfortable , so good thing I was n't going to wear them .
All right .
So why did I do that ?
That was awkward .
Well , hopefully not as awkward as that picture .
Image is powerful , but also image is superficial .
I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds .
And in this picture , I had actually never had a boyfriend in real life .
So today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
And I am on this stage because I am a model .
And I 'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest twist .
So the first question is , how do you become a model ?
And I always just say , " Oh , I was scouted , " but that means nothing .
And first , I commend you on your model knowledge . Very impressive .
You know ? You can be anything .
It 's out of your control , and it 's awesome , and it 's not a career path .
It will look something like this .
Hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle .
That was , I do n't know what happened there .
The next question people always ask me is , " Do they retouch all the photos ? "
I know we 're getting personal , but I was a young girl .
This is what I looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier .
Here 's me on the same day as this shoot .
My friend got to come with me .
Here 's me at a slumber party a few days before I shot French Vogue .
Here 's me on the soccer team and in V Magazine .
And here 's me today .
And I hope what you 're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me .
Okay , so the next question people always ask me is , " Do you get free stuff ? "
but " How many times will I get stopped ? When will I get stopped ? "
So the last question people ask me is , " What is it like to be a model ? "
And when we 're backstage , we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that .
And I 'm insecure because I have to think about what I look like every day .
Thank you .
But do n't you ever turn into a Gaddafi - like revolutionary . "
And there it was , a great revolution .
They have shown an exemplary bravery in confronting the brutal dictatorship of Gaddafi .
Eventually , our initiative was adopted and successful .
Women won 17.5 percent of the National Congress in the first elections ever in 52 years .
One day we wake up to the news of the desecration of ancient mosques and Sufi tombs .
On another day we wake up to the news of the assassination of army officers .
Intolerance , exclusion and revenge became the icons of the [ aftermath ] of the revolution .
We did not prioritize right .
For elections did not bring peace and stability and security in Libya .
Did the zipper list and the alternation between female and male candidates bring peace and national reconciliation ?
No , it did n't .
What is it , then ?
We need to stop acting as agents of rage and calling for days of rage .
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy .
These are the ideals that a war - torn Libya needs desperately in order to achieve peace .
That 's the real zipper .
And we need to establish that existentially before we do so sociopolitically .
Thus we are told that " My mercy encompasses all things . "
Thus we are told that " My mercy takes precedence over my anger . "
May we all be granted a grace of mercy .
Thank you .
And I was very proud .
My family was not poor , and myself , I had never experienced hunger .
But one day , in 1995 , my mom brought home a letter from a coworker 's sister .
I was so shocked .
This was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering .
A huge famine hit North Korea in the mid-1990s .
I always wondered why they had lights but we did n't .
This is a satellite picture showing North Korea at night compared to neighbors .
This is the Amrok River , which serves as a part of the border between North Korea and China .
But many die .
Sometimes , I saw dead bodies floating down the river .
But I only thought that I would be separated from my family for a short time .
I could have never imagined that it would take 14 years to live together .
In China , it was hard living as a young girl without my family .
I was so scared , I thought my heart was going to explode .
If anything seemed unnatural , I could be imprisoned and repatriated .
After they finished questioning me , one official said to another , " This was a false report .
She 's not North Korean . "
And they let me go . It was a miracle .
These girls were so lucky .
Even though they were caught , they were eventually released after heavy international pressure .
These North Koreans were not so lucky .
Even though I was really fortunate to get out , many other North Koreans have not been so lucky .
It 's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive .
Settling down in South Korea was a lot more challenging than I had expected .
English was so important in South Korea , so I had to start learning my third language .
Also , I realized there was a wide gap between North and South .
I even went through an identity crisis .
Am I South Korean or North Korean ?
Where am I from ? Who am I ?
Suddenly , there was no country I could proudly call my own .
Even though adjusting to life in South Korea was not easy , I made a plan .
I started studying for the university entrance exam .
Just as I was starting to get used to my new life , I received a shocking phone call .
They had to get out quickly , so I started planning how to help them escape .
North Koreans have to travel incredible distances on the path to freedom .
The journey by bus took one week , and we were almost caught several times .
One time , our bus was stopped and boarded by a Chinese police officer .
He took everyone 's I.D. cards , and he started asking them questions .
Since my family could n't understand Chinese , I thought my family was going to be arrested .
He looked at me suspiciously , but luckily he believed me .
But even after we got past the border , my family was arrested and jailed for illegal border crossing .
This was one of the lowest points in my life .
I lost all hope .
At that moment , I heard one man 's voice ask me , " What 's wrong ? "
I was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
" I 'm not helping you , " he said .
" I 'm helping the North Korean people . "
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
Thank you .
Today I have just one request .
Please do n't tell me I 'm normal .
Now I 'd like to introduce you to my brothers .
Remi is 22 , tall and very handsome .
Remi knows what love is .
He shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless .
He 's not greedy . He does n't see skin color .
Samuel is 16 . He 's tall . He 's very handsome .
He has the most impeccable memory .
He has a selective one , though .
Do n't they sound incredible ?
But most people do n't agree .
It manifests in each individual differently , hence why Remi is so different from Sam .
And after a few months went by , I realized that he was different .
He screamed a lot .
And as he grew older , he grew more different , and the differences became more obvious .
Extraordinary .
It just means that there 's a different kind of right .
You can be extraordinary .
Please -- do n't tell me I 'm normal .
Thank you .
How does light look in slow motion ?
Now , the whole event
But , Coca - Cola did not sponsor this research .
Some of the light leaks , goes on the table , and you start seeing these ripples of waves .
Many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions .
As you can see , there 's a bubble of air , and it 's bouncing around inside .
A day , a week ? Actually , a whole year .
It 'll be a very boring movie — — of a slow , ordinary bullet in motion .
And what about some still - life photography ?
You can watch the ripples again washing over the table , the tomato and the wall in the back .
It 's like throwing a stone in a pond of water .
So how did my team at MIT create this camera ?
And we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways .
So , Superman can fly .
The idea is that we could shine some light on the door .
And it 's not science fiction . We have actually built it .
On the left , you see our femto - camera .
There 's a mannequin hidden behind a wall , and we 're going to bounce light off the door .
It has very good time resolution , and it can look at the world at the speed of light .
Can we see it in full 3D ?
So this is our reconstruction .
But there 's also something funny going on here .
The ripples should be moving towards us .
What 's going on here ?
It 's about time . Thank you .
There are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .
How can we lend and borrow more things without knocking on each other 's doors at a bad time ?
Now , I live in New Orleans , and I am in love with New Orleans .
I feel like every time someone sneezes , New Orleans has a parade .
In 2009 , I lost someone I loved very much .
But I struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life .
And I 'd like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall .
" Before I die , I want to be tried for piracy . "
" Before I die , I want to straddle the International Date Line . "
" Before I die , I want to sing for millions . "
" Before I die , I want to plant a tree . "
" Before I die , I want to live off the grid . "
" Before I die , I want to hold her one more time . "
" Before I die , I want to be someone 's cavalry . "
" Before I die , I want to be completely myself . "
It 's about knowing you 're not alone .
It 's about understanding our neighbors in new and enlightening ways .
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people .
Thinking about death clarifies your life .
Thank you .
Thank you .
No one knows what the hell we do .
So , dancing is one of the most human of activities .
We delight at ballet virtuosos and tap dancers you will see later on .
So great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
But what if patients could do this test at home ?
No expensive staff time required .
Takes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neurologist 's clinic to do it .
So here we have a video of the vibrating vocal folds .
And like ballet , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
I mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
So on the bottom trace , you can see an example of irregular vocal fold tremor .
We see all the same symptoms .
We see vocal tremor , weakness and rigidity .
The neurologist 's test is non - invasive . They both use existing infrastructure .
You do n't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
That means they can be self - administered .
They 're high - speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
They 're ultra - low cost , and we all know what happens .
When something becomes ultra - low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
So here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now .
We can reduce logistical difficulties with patients .
No need to go to the clinic for a routine checkup .
We can do high - frequency monitoring to get objective data .
So , taking the first steps towards this today , we 're launching the Parkinson 's Voice Initiative .
We have local numbers accessible to three quarters of a billion people on the planet .
Thank you .
What are you going to get out of those samples ?
You see , some people may not do it . They may not get through it .
So you 're 86 percent accurate right now ?
It 's much better than that .
Ninety - nine . Well , that 's an improvement .
Absolutely .
Thanks so much . Max Little , everybody .
Thanks , Tom .
So predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
They kill our livestock .
So I grew up hating lions so much .
So they kill the lions .
It 's one of the six lions which were killed in Nairobi .
And I think this is why the Nairobi National Park lions are few .
So I had to find a way of solving this problem .
And the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought lions were scared of fire .
So I did n't give up . I continued .
And a second idea I got was to use a scarecrow .
I was trying to trick the lions [ into thinking ] that I was standing near the cowshed .
But lions are very clever .
So he jumps in and kills the animals .
And I discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
So I had an idea .
And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
And that 's a small torch from a broken flashlight .
So I set up everything .
And the indicator box makes the lights flash .
As you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that 's where the lions come from .
And that 's how it looks to lions when they come at night .
Thanks .
And my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
One of them was this grandmother .
And I said , " Yes . "
So I put the lights . You can see at the back , those are the lion lights .
Since now , I 've set up seven homes around my community , and they 're really working .
My new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
And here I am today .
I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED .
So my big dream is to become an aircraft engineer and pilot when I grow up .
Ashê olên . It means in my language , thank you very much .
You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
So you got this scholarship . Yep .
You 're working on other electrical inventions .
What 's the next one on your list ?
My next invention is , I want to make an electric fence . Electric fence ?
But I know electric fences are already invented , but I want to make mine .
In the trenches . Richard Turere , you are something else .
We 're going to cheer you on every step of the way , my friend .
Thank you so much . Thank you .
In fact , most of them were taken by random tourists .
Well you can see where this is going .
This is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture .
No one 's ever refused , and luckily no one 's ever run off with our camera .
Back then , we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives .
It 's really become sacred to us .
So these photos are far more than proxies for a single moment , or even a specific trip .
And it hit me : One of the most important things we all make are memories .
I 'm always the one taking the picture .
Thank you .
